            <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; "> The pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well-developed muscles.

                Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family.
                
                Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug"> More info </a></p>

               <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; " >The Poodle, called the Pudel in German and the Caniche in French, is a breed of water dog. The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle, although the Medium Poodle variety is not universally recognised.

                The Poodle most likely originated in Germany, although it is also claimed to be from France. The Standard Poodle was originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water. The smaller varieties of the breed were bred from the original in France where they were once commonly used as circus performers, but have become popular companion dogs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle">For more info</a></p>

               <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; " >Husky is a general term for a dog used in the polar regions, primarily and specifically for work as sled dogs. It refers to a traditional northern type, notable for its cold-weather tolerance and overall hardiness.[1][2] Though dogs such as the AKC/CKC-registered Alaskan Malamute may not contain "Husky" in their official name, the term still encompasses dogs of their type.[citation needed] Modern racing huskies that maintain arctic breed traits (also known as Alaskan huskies) represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs.[3][4]

                Huskies have continued to be used in sled-dog racing, as well as expedition and trek style tour businesses, and as a means of essential transportation in rural communities.[5] Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husky">Click Here</a> </p>
